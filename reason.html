            <h2>Questions with Reasons :</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Question 1</b><br> What is phishing? <br>
                Ans: b) A cyber attack to steal sensitive information<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Phishing is a type of cyberattack in which attackers pose as reliable organisations in order to trick victims into disclosing critical information. Identity theft and money gain are the main motivations behind phishing.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 2</b><br> What is the primary method of communication used in phishing attacks?<br>
                Ans: d) Email<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> The primary method of communication used in phishing scams is email. This investigation attempts to comprehend the frequently used phishing channel in order to inform people about the risks of opening <b>questionab</b><br>e emails and to urge caution when doing so.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 3</b><br> Phishing emails often contain:<br>
                Ans: c) Requests for sensitive information<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Phishing emails often contain deceptive elements such as false logos, links to fake websites, or requests for personal information. Attackers include these elements to create a sense of legitimacy and trick recipients into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that benefit the attackers.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 4</b><br> What is a characteristic of spear phishing?<br>
                Ans: c) It targets a specific individual or organization<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Spear phishing is characterised by its use of personalised and targeted messaging to target particular people or groups. By taking advantage of the familiarity and trust between the sender and the recipient, this strategy makes the attack more effective and makes it more difficult to identify and defend against.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 5</b><br> What is the purpose of a phishing website?<br>
                Ans: c) To steal personal or financial information<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> A phishing website's objective is to trick users into divulging critical information, including login passwords or financial information. Attackers design these phoney websites to look like authentic ones in an effort to dupe users into thinking they are communicating with a reliable organisation. This facilitates the theft of personal information for illicit </b><br>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 6</b><br> "What is a red flag of a phishing email?<br>
                Ans:a)  A generic greeting like 'Dear User'<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Grammar errors, misspellings, or strange phrase usage are warning signs of phishing emails. This raises suspicion because genuine businesses often communicate in a professional and error-free manner, whereas phishing emails frequently have linguistic errors because the attackers didn't pay attention to detail or didn't speak English well.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 7</b><br> How can you verify the authenticity of a suspicious email?<br>
                Ans: c) Check the sender's email address and scrutinize any URLs<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> You can verify the authenticity of a suspicious email by independently contacting the supposed sender through official channels or by directly visiting their official website. This approach ensures that you are communicating with the legitimate organization and not relying solely on the information provided in the suspicious email, which could be fabricated by attackers.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 8</b><br> What is the best action to take if you receive a phishing email?<br>
                Ans: c) Delete it immediately<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> The best action to take if you receive a phishing email is to not click on any links or download any attachments, and delete the email immediately. This ensures you avoid potential risks associated with phishing attacks, such as malware infections or inadvertently providing sensitive information to attackers.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 9</b><br> How can you protect yourself from phishing attacks?<br>
                Ans: d) Being cautious of unsolicited emails and verifying the source<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> You should be cautious when opening emails or messages, avoid clicking on dubious links, avoid downloading attachments, and use security software that is frequently updated. By taking these precautions, you reduce your chance of falling for phishing scams and guard against the compromising of your personal information.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 10</b><br> How can you verify the legitimacy of a website's SSL certificate?<br>
                Ans: d) Click on any links within the website to test its security<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> To verify the legitimacy of a website's SSL certificate, check the browser's address bar for a padlock symbol and ensure the URL starts with "https://".Click on the padlock to view certificate details, ensuring it's issued by a reputable Certificate Authority and the domain matches the website's address.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 11</b><br>What does it mean when an email asks for urgent action, such as clicking a link immediately?<br>
                Ans: c) It's a common phishing tactic to create panic and prevent critical thinking<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> When an email asks for urgent action, such as immediately clicking a link, it's often a red flag indicating a phishing attempt, leveraging urgency to bypass the recipient's rational judgment and gain unauthorized access or information. Always verify the email's source before taking any action.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 12</b><br> How can you verify the authenticity of an email from a recognized organization?<br>
                Ans: d) Independently search for the official contact information and verify with them<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> To verify the authenticity of an email from a recognized organization, check the sender's email address for slight variations or misspellings and cross-reference the information or request with the official website or by contacting the organization directly through known, official channels. <br>Avoid clicking on any links or attachments until authenticity is confirmed.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 13</b><br>What is 'domain spoofing' in phishing emails?<br>
                Ans: Altering the sender's display name to mimic a legitimate domain<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Domain spoofing in phishing emails involves the attacker using a fake email address that closely resembles a legitimate domain, aiming to deceive the recipient into believing the email is from a trustworthy source. This tactic exploits the recipient's trust in familiar domain names to obtain sensitive information or deliver malware.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 14</b><br> Which characteristic in an email is a strong indicator of a phishing attempt?<br>
                Ans: b) Requests for personal or financial information<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Unexpected requests for sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card details, especially when paired with a sense of urgency, are strong indicators of a phishing attempt. Attackers exploit urgency to prompt hasty actions without critical scrutiny, potentially compromising security.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 15</b><br> Why is inspecting the email header useful in identifying phishing?<br>
                Ans: c) It provides insight into the email's origin and authenticity<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Why is inspecting the email header useful in identifying phishing?
                Inspecting the email header provides detailed information about the email's origin and the path it took, allowing one to identify discrepancies or suspicious attributes that wouldn't be visible in the email body. A mismatch between the stated sender in the email body and the actual source in the header can reveal deceptive tactics used by phishers.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 16</b><br>What should you do if you receive an unexpected email with a suspicious attachment?<br>
                Ans: c) Ignore the attachment and mark the email as spam<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> If you receive an unexpected email with a suspicious attachment, avoid opening the attachment or clicking any links, as it could contain malware. Instead, verify the sender's authenticity through separate, known communication channels before taking any action, ensuring your device's security isn't compromised.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 17</b><br> Why should you be cautious of emails with generic greetings like 'Dear User'?<br>
                Ans: d) It could be a sign that the sender doesn't have your actual name<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Be cautious of emails with generic greetings like 'Dear User' because legitimate organizations typically address customers by their full name. Generic greetings can indicate mass-sent phishing attempts where attackers lack specific details about the recipient, aiming to cast a wide net for potential victims.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 18</b><br> What's the best approach if you receive a suspicious link via email?<br>
                Ans: b) Hover over the link without clicking to see the actual URL<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> If you receive a suspicious link via email, avoid clicking on it to prevent potential security breaches. Instead, verify the legitimacy of the request by contacting the purported sender directly through a known, official channel, ensuring you aren't inadvertently accessing malicious content.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 19</b><br> What is phishing?<br>
                Ans: b) A type of cyberattack.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Phishing is a form of cyberattack where malicious actors attempt to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive or personal information, such as login credentials or financial data, by pretending to be a legitimate and trustworthy source.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 20</b><br> Which of the following is a common phishing tactic?<br>
                Ans: c) Creating a sense of urgency.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> :Phishers often use urgency as a tactic to manipulate victims into taking quick actions without thinking critically.By creating a sense of urgency in their phishing messages, they pressure individuals into making hasty decisions, such as clicking on
                malicious links or sharing sensitive information.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 21</b><br> What is a common goal of phishing attacks?<br>
                Ans: a) To gain unauthorized access to a system.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> typically by tricking individuals into revealing login credentials or other sensitive information. Phishing attacks aim to exploit and compromise the security of systems and user accounts for malicious purposes.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 22</b><br> Which of the following is NOT a common phishing communication method?<br>
                Ans: d) Physical mail.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> typically by tricking individuals into revealing login credentials or other sensitive information. Phishing attacks aim to exploit and compromise the security of systems and user accounts for malicious purposes.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 23</b><br>What is spear phishing?<br>
                Ans: c) Highly targeted phishing attacks.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> typically by tricking individuals into revealing login credentials or other sensitive information.Phishing attacks aim to exploit and compromise the security of systems and user accounts for malicious purposes.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 24</b><br>Which of the following should you do if you receive an
                unsolicited email requesting personal information or payment?<br>
                Ans: c) Delete the email and do not engage with it.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> because responding to unsolicited requests for personal information or payment can put you at risk of falling victim to phishing scams or other cyberattacks. Clicking on links or downloading attachments from such<br> emails can also introduce malware or compromise your security.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 25</b><br>What is the purpose of two-factor authentication (2FA)?<br>
                Ans: b) To protect against unauthorized access.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> It requires something the user knows (password) and something the user possesses (e.g., a mobile device) to verify their identity, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access<br> to accounts, even if they have the password.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 26</b><br>Which of the following is a red flag for a phishing email?<br>
                Ans: a) A generic greeting like 'Dear User'.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> a red flag for a phishing email because legitimate organizations usually address individuals by their name.Phishers often use generic greetings to cast a wide net,targeting a large number of potential victims without <br>knowing their specific identities,which is a common characteristic of phishing attempts.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 27</b><br> What is the primary purpose of a phishing simulation?<br>
                Ans: b) To educate and train individuals on recognizing
                phishing attempts.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> These simulations create controlled environments to help users learn to identify phishing emails and actions, ultimately improving their ability to protect themselves from real phishing attacks. It is not intended to <br>collect personal information from users, as that would be unethical and potentially illegal.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 28</b><br> What should you do if you suspect you've fallen victim to
                a phishing attack?<br>
                Ans: "b) Report it to your organization's IT department or
                administrator.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> because they can take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact of the phishing attack, such as securing your accounts, investigating the incident, and implementing measures to prevent further attacks. <br>Ignoring it or responding to the phishing email can lead to further security risks, and posting about<br> it on social media may not provide the
                necessary help and could expose sensitive information.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 29</b><br>Which of these email signs may indicate a phishing attempt?<br>
                Ans: c) The email asks for sensitive information or money.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> may indicate a phishing attempt because legitimate organizations usually do not request sensitive information or financial transactions via unsolicited emails. Phishing emails often use these tactics to deceive <br>recipients into providing valuable personal data or making payments to cybercriminals.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 30</b><br>How can you verify the authenticity of a suspicious email?<br>
                Ans: c) Contact the organization or person directly using
                official contact information.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> because it allows you to verify the email's legitimacy independently. Clicking links or forwarding the email can potentially lead to further security risks or propagate the phishing attempt, while <br>replying to the email may not guarantee a genuine response from the organization or individual.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 31</b><br> What is a common tactic used by phishing emails to create a sense of urgency?<br>
                Ans: b) Threatening legal action<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> a common tactic used by phishing emails to create a sense of urgency. By claiming that legal consequences will follow unless immediate action is taken, phishers aim to pressure recipients into hastily <br>complying with their demands or clicking on malicious links. This urgency tactic exploits fear and can <br>lead individuals to make
                impulsive decisions, playing into the hands of the attacker.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 32</b><br>Which of the following is a secure way to enter login credentials?<br>
                Ans: d) Verify its authenticity before taking any action.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> because it's crucial to exercise caution when dealing with suspicious emails. Verifying its legitimacy by independently contacting the organization or individual or using official contact information can help<br> you determine if it's a legitimate communication or a potential phishing attempt. <br>Clicking links or ignoring it without verification can lead to security risks.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 33</b><br> What should you do if you receive a suspicious email but are
                not sure if it's phishing?<br>
                Ans: d) Verify its authenticity before taking any action.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> because it's crucial to exercise caution when dealing with suspicious emails. Verifying its legitimacy by independently contacting the organization or individual or using official contact information can<br> help you determine if it's a legitimate communication or a potential phishing attempt. <br>Clicking links or ignoring it without verification can lead to security risks.
                <br><br>  
                <b>Question 34</b><br> How can you verify the authenticity of a website before entering
                sensitive information?<br>
                Ans: c) Look for a padlock icon in the browser's address bar.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> The presence of a padlock icon in the browser's address bar indicates that the website has an SSL certificate and is using secure encryption for data transmission, providing assurance of a safer connection.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 35</b><br> What is the term used to describe a targeted phishing attack on
                high-profile individuals?<br>
                Ans: b) Whaling<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> Whaling refers to phishing attacks specifically aimed at high-profile individuals, such as executives or celebrities, who may have valuable information or access to sensitive systems.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 36</b><br>What is the purpose of a phishing email?<br>
                Ans: c) To collect personal information.<br>
                <b>Reason:</b><br> The primary objective of a phishing email is to trick the recipient into providing personal information, such as login credentials or financial details, to the attacker.
                <br><br>
                <b>Question 37</b><br>What is the purpose of a phishing website?<br>
                Ans: a) To trick users into entering sensitive information.<br>
